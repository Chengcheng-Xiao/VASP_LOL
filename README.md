# VASP - Localized Orbital Locator + Electron Localizability Indicator
This project provides patch files for VASP v6.3.0 that:
1. Enabling calculation of the Localized Orbital Locator (LOL)
2. Enabling calculation of the Electron Localizability Indicators (ELI) parallel-spin electron pair density (D)
3. Fixing [a bug](https://www.vasp.at/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18361) in spin
polarized electron localization function calculations.
4. Updating ELF calculation so that no fictitious high localization will occur in
the vacuum region (see [Tian Lu and Fei-Wu Chen, Meaning and Functional Form of
the Electron Localization Function, Acta Phys. -Chim. Sin. 27 (12), (2011),
2786-2792](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/apcs/apcs/2011/00000027/00000012/art00011?crawler=true))

## Applying patches
1. To enable LOL, ELI-D and the ELF bug fix all together, put the `VASP6.3_ELI_D.patch` under `$VASP_SOURCE` folder
 and issue the following command:
```
patch -p0 < VASP6.3_ELI_D.patch
```

2. To fix the ELF bug, put the `VASPv6.3.0_ELF.patch` under `$VASP_SOURCE` folder
 and issue the following command:
```
patch -p0 < VASP6.3_ELF.patch
```
3. To enable LOL calculation, put `VASPv6.3.0_LOL.patch` under `$VASP_SOURCE`
and issue the following command:
```
patch -p0 < VASP6.3_LOL.patch
```

## Running calculations
Setting `LLOL=.TRUE.` in `INCAR` file will enable the calculation of LOL at the end of the single point cycle.
A file named `LOLCAR` is generated after the calculation.

Setting `LELID=.TRUE.` in `INCAR` file will enable the calculation of ELID at the end of the single point cycle.
A file named `ELIDCAR` is generated after the calculation.

__Note__: [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) treates `LOLCAR` and `ELIDCAR` as charge
density object so the iso-value displayed by it is divided by the volume of the unitcell. You might want to rename them as `ELFCAR_LOL` and `ELFCAR_ELID`
